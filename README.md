# NYPDShootingData
This project is by Misha Ohri, Aamina Choudhry, Riya Pottapinjara, and Kimaya Dhall, and has been created for our i310D class final.
Our code came from Hands-On Exercises, applying our class work/knowledge, and Chat GPT 3.5

Our problem pertains to the question: “Can we use information about shooting incidents to determine whether or not the incident was a murder based on NYPD shooting incident data and relevant variables?”. To determine this, we worked with a data set focusing on variables such as a borough, the perpetrator and victim's age, sex and race, and the borough the incident took place in. Our goal was to use this information to predict the likelihood of an incident being a murder and to do this, we transformed the data into binary and attempted to use machine learning technology such as logistic regression and MLP classifier to train and predict the likelihood of it being a murder or not.
